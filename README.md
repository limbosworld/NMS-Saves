# The Purge 15 of 16

A save game file for creative mode players who want to skip most of the quests and get straight to exploring or building. 

## Description

If you are a long-time player and chronic restarter (like me), this will help you each time you want to start a new save. When you load the game, you will be about 5 minutes away from choosing a new galaxy.

4.  Quit the game
5.  Open NMSSaveEditor and open the newly created save - Make sure you are on the right one
6.  Click Edit Raw JSON
7.  Select all code and delete it
8.  Open the JSON file you downloaded with a suitable editor like Sublime Text or Notepad++

#### When you restart your new save, you will now be on a Paradise planet next to a portal with just a base computer, a teleporter and your ship. Get in your ship and warp once in any direction. You will now be at 16 of 16 and the final interface will appear.

#### Once you land, activate and enter it, you will soon be in front of the Atlas and be able to pick your new galaxy. Put down a base computer and teleporter somewhere and you can travel back and forth to Euclid.
